# Google Form Automation For SMKTPD School

### Why I made this?
To solve the problem where I need to fill up the google form daily for the kehadiran which is quite annoying.

### How to use?
Make sure that you install the Node.js.
If not, install the Node.js at https://nodejs.org/en/

1. Open your terminal (like a hacker)
2. Clone this repository or download the zip (unzip it) to your own computer
3. Go into this directory
3. Run this commmand (it may take longer than your expected)

```
npm i
```

4. Change your name, class in index.js for the first time only
5. Run this command 

```
npm start
```

6. Enter your current subject
7. The date, subject, form, class, your beautiful name will be showing in the terminal
8. If any error occur, run the command again (most probably your network is slow)
